### Misc

Setup your editor to remove trailing white space on save (or command if you preffer), eg. with [vscode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30884298/3103033). Additionally setup your editor to use trailing new lines at the end of files (it just looks nice and it is easier when adding new stuff to the bottom of files).
